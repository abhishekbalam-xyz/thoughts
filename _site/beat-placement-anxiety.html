<blockquote>
  <p>“What do you want to do in life?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question, when asked to an Indian youngster my age, would ideally generate any of the following two types of responses:</p>
<ol>
  <li>An optimistic brief idea of what they plan to do for the next 5-10 years, with enthusiasm and very little apprehension</li>
  <li>Nervous exressions accompanying vague plans to give a bunch of competitive exams to pursue further studies, or take up a job in an <X> field</X></li>
  <li>They shrug their shoulders , saying they dont know but some distress showing the underlying insecurity and fear they feel about their future prospects, sometimes hidden under an uneasy smile…</li>
</ol>

<p>The former are the optimists, the confident trailblazers, ready to take on the world . They have been idealising a perfect life in their head for a long time and when finally given a chance to earn it, are prepared, emotionally, and with the skillset they have honed in their college years, to face the challenges the world has to offer.</p>

<p>They aren’t idiots, they know it will be tough, they know what will it cost, but they aren’t afraid because they have done their research, and they know how to improvise to knock the difficulties that come in their out of the park.They know this because they know what it takes to succeede, coz they know the focus and hardwork and sacrifices they need to make to get there, coz they had done all of it to get to where they are.</p>

<p>These are the startup guys, highest (salary) placed, the ones who got into the colleges of their choice. 
And now is the time of their lives, they feel like Gladiators entering the Colosseum, after alot of tortous practice to make a killing out there. High on the sweet nectar of success and high on andrenaline for the exciting future that lies ahead of them..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“ Annoying pompous turds! “</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thought of as atleast once in the minds of the youngsters belonging to the other two demographics..</p>

<p>Their story is’nt all that glamorous, but a little bit more interesting.The truth is, the majority lies in the latter two demographics and their’s is the story no one talks about.</p>

<p>And this post is about them, the silent majority.</p>

<p>Now lets explore the  story of the second group.</p>

<p>These are the realists</p>
<ul>
  <li>who don’t care about being the best in a field</li>
  <li>they don’t have to prove the world anything about themselves</li>
  <li>they aren’t all that passionate about an idea</li>
</ul>

<p>They are the ones who just want to just live a comfortable and happy life. All their decisions are centered around this basic idea , to secure their future . Simple.</p>

<p>They worked their ass off to study subjects they didn’t really care about, but only because good grades were needed to secure their future and that was good enough motivation. They enjoyed the finer things college and school had to offer them, while being realistic about things.</p>

<p>They seem like the vanilla ice cream of the group, but it’s a pretty comfortable sweet spot to be in..</p>

<p>Then come the last group.</p>

<p>Ahhh, they are the people who had juusst a little too much fun, studied a little bit lesser and occasionally threw causion to the air and went all in , enjoying their life.</p>

<p>These are the people who know how to live life! They do what they want and leave no stone unturned to fulfill their short term goals.</p>

<p>And alas, naturally, as bad grades transalate to a bad rep, irrespective of capability or intelligence, they aren’t able to get placed and their future prospects seem dim.</p>

<p>This group feels the worst during this time.  Depression, uncertainty, and anxiety take over. Familial and societal pressures not adding up.</p>

<p>I have many friends who are worried about their future prospects, and all the things happening around them, the bitter truth of reality and the struggle in life is beginning to reveal itself…</p>

<p>And they’d be stupid if they were’nt.</p>

<p>Ill admit I’m a part of the last group and I’m pretty scared too. I am going through a gap year and I’ll be in their position next year..So looking at them, now that I have the luxury of being an objective observer I can see things a bit clearly, as compared to when being in their place, when emotions cloud the judgement and fear and anxiety take over the reigns from reason. This post, in a way is to remind me, next year, of the important things to remember if I happen to be in a situation when I do not get placed or am uncertain of my future prospects..</p>

<p>Most of the friends who feel a bit low right now, <strong>dont have a why</strong> ..</p>

<p>Fear takes over when in the prospect of doom and it limits our ability to take risks. The natural “flight” response that our adrenal glands so happily provide. And it also restricts the minds ability to be creative, to seek out new avenues .</p>

<p>From what I am seeing around me, many want to have a job, so that they dont feel left behind in life. The core desire is fear, and when the desire isnt met, it causes all the trouble.</p>

<p>So, instead of fear, what if the reason is having a strong sense of purpose . A strong why.</p>

<p>Having a definite sense of direction makes one feel like being more in control of the situation and their reaction to it..This is when one can take action to direct the outcome to make it more favourable, by <strong>taking action</strong> and <strong>remembering priorities</strong></p>

<h3 id="taking-action">Taking Action</h3>

<p>When a friend of mine got rejected from the company he really wanted to join, he felt so hopeless and gave in to the fear. After taking some time to rethink things, and me giving him a pep talk, he realised  that he still had time to get placed at a better company that the one before and so he started to work for it. He looked up online videos to polish his interview skills, he started to read the newspapers to keep him well informed of current events for the Group Discussions and practiced aptitude papers to improve his confidence.</p>

<p>All of this action added upto him getting placed at a better company..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the lesson is to dust off a singular failure and keep marching forward</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="remembering-priorities">Remembering Priorities</h3>

<p>There was a friend who had just tanked an interview for an important company. This setback hurt her. And simultaneously she had taken up alot of extracurricular responsibilites during this time and her attention was divided and soon she was too overwhelmed to do anything. This gave rise to a bigger meaner brother of fear, anxiety. I had met her after a long time she was drained of all the energy that was so characteristic of her. I helped her understand that she needs to remove distractions and unnecessary stressors from around her and focus on whats more important.</p>

<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD and I tend to lose focus pretty quick, and the love of novelty of doing new things, I end up taking up more work than I can handle. I need to be aware of when I am making this mistake.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Priorities are intentions of achievement and unless they arent in order and in focus, we cant reach any goal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from these 2 things to remember, I realised that the most important and least spoken-of thing is to maintain a postive attitude.</p>

<p>Positivity goes a long way in making you see the lighter side of problems, the silver linings in the dark clouds. We dont have much control over the occurence and dissapearance of the clouds, but we do have the power of perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just by maintaing a positive attitude, one can turn a disaster into an opportunity . Well, isnt that a better way to live?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can develop a sense of positivity by eating good food, exercise and meditation. I know these sound so boring, but the effort is worth it.</p>

<p>Next year when I enter the placement period, which is a better way to go ? With fear and apprehention , or with abundant enthusiasm and confidence that is provided by the simple act of being positive.</p>

<p>I will read this post back to myself next year, to center myself .</p>
