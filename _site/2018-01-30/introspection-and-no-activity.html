  <p>Today,</p>
<ul>
  <li>I skipped the gym</li>
  <li>Woke up late</li>
  <li>Carb filled breakfast and unfavourable lunch, albeit home made</li>
</ul>

<p>But I did some thinking today….
I was looking up the difference in the beliefs and policies of the political “Left” and “Right” and that led to me looking up Indias political system’s structure and brief history. After pouring through one blog post/wiki article/news site to another, I realised that I enjoyed knowing this stuf, about how individual interests are representd at a national level.</p>

<p>And that got me to the thought maybe I should attempt to give the UPSC exams. Not for a job, if just just for the fun of learning atleast. I say that I am an Indian buy I hardly know anything about this country I live in.</p>

<p>My life revolves around 3 or 4 zipcode wide radius for most of my days and I end up being cocconed, not knowing whats outside. 
As I did some research ,on how and what to learn for the toughest exam in the country, as agreed by all pages..</p>

<p>BUT, I was wondering if I do prepare for this exam, as an excuse to learn as much about the various aspects of the collective of people of 1.3Bn people who populate this land.</p>

<p>Also, now that I think about it, it was always in my plan to serve the people in the country for some finite time in some way before I go making my money…</p>

<p>But also I remember this priority list  taught at my Yoga class:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You</li>
  <li>Family/Friends</li>
  <li>Work</li>
  <li>Community</li>
</ol>

<p>This is making me evaluate how will I approach the things I need to do in life..</p>

<p>I also figured out that I need to distance myself from a person. The person was in need and I helped, out of a sense of duty/care. But now the person has a few more crutched for support, maybe I need to slowly move away….I think its the right thing to do, coz no part of me sees any future dealings . Live and let live. But most importantly, live.</p>

<p>Some decisions need to be made, idk if I will make them on time.</p>

<p>Also, is this fear creeping about not getting a job firstly, but that feels like a good thing. Fear is good, coz if I were too cocky, id manifest as anxiety. Where fear is a motivator, anxiety is a crippler.</p>

<p>Look at me,so much has changed in my thinking. Real, positive and practical its become. Good.</p>

<p>Will need to figure these things out, maybe this will help me break out of the stagnancy in my life right now…</p>

<p>Lets see.</p>
