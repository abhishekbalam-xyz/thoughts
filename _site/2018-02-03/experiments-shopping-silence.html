  <p>Woke up late today, but took a fresh bath and went to the temple in the morning..</p>

<p>So I was super psyched to switched to Netlify , because it all these new tools and integrated features</p>
<ul>
  <li>Https free with letsencrypt</li>
  <li>form handling</li>
  <li>functions/lambdas with github</li>
  <li>integrated dns</li>
  <li>cli to deploy</li>
  <li>supports other generators too (than jekyll)</li>
  <li>and a load of other stuff for free</li>
</ul>

<p>Alas, after 3 hours wasted trying to fix up my site, I had alot of issues with the DNS , which is still in <code class="highlighter-rouge">beta</code> btw..</p>

<p>Another problem I faced was that there was so little support apart from the documentaion..</p>

<p>Maybe someday it will become good enough for that, I hope it works..</p>

<p>Did Check out surge though …</p>

<p>Moved this site to Surge now, completely…Maybe Ill remove the fake repo and account?Maybe..</p>

<p>Surge is fucking quick too,coz it takes just the static content and propagates across its CDN quickly, unlike Github Pages..</p>

<p>Also..Cloudfront gives free SSL!! Netlify can suck ass now, I dont need it anymore..</p>

<p>I did it bitch! What an amazing time to live!</p>

<p>Mic drops, jumps into imaginary crowd cheering for having hosted a website (that too SSL encrypted) for a total of Rs.80 this year (just for the domain) …</p>
