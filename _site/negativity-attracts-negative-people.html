  <h1 class="post-title">Negativity attracts negative people.</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>I have realised recently that more negative you are, the more negative people you attract, and by attract I dont mean just romantically, in general.</p>

<p>I’ve seen this in my own life and I did meet many who were more negative and that affected me too..</p>

<p>After alot of effort, time and energy I have removed the negativity within me.</p>

<p>The inverse is also true though, more positive I am , more of those I attract..</p>

<p>That’s my plan now…</p>

<p>It’s not worth your time or energy to keep people around, who even though are well meaning, or are good people, so you got to drop them.</p>

<p>How do I try being positive?</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am optimistic about my future</li>
  <li>Take care of your body</li>
  <li>Sleep well</li>
  <li>Eat clean, not junk</li>
  <li>Keep setting goals, and strive to achieve them. Never settle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thats it for now..</p>

<p>Life is to be lived once, do it justice .</p>
