title: "Old ghosts still haunt me"
---

I couldnt sleep the night before, so I could start the day at 4.30am..

Sun was late to rise, so I waited till 5.30am to go.

That's when the day started going to shit. I entered the gym after 2 days, weighing 97kgs, the heaviest I've been in 4 years..

This brought back the many demons that used to haunt me. I could feel the darkness setting in, slowly, like a fungus feeding on my energies.

What demons? The ones who put me in a shell, and in the name of protecting me from hurt, shuts me off from human interactiona and bars me from even prospect of intimacy. 

It makes me this skeptical asshole who, in the name of self sufficiency, doesnt let me trust anyone. Preventing any valuable human contact. Deepening its roots into my psyche and affecting all my decision making, subconsciously guiding me away from happiness...

Wanted to learn perl , but I have no use for it right now, so that can wait...

I did have a good conversation with an old friend..She is the only person who makes me calm down..Talking to her made me feel good.

Silver lining I guess..

Anyways, lets see what the future holds.
