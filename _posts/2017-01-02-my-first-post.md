Today was a weird day.
Woke up to a horrible nightmare of murders and guilts .
I found out that I had a leptin resistance and that my brain was healing too ..

Went to the doc and he said I have a bit of a grip on the reins of my mind..
But, idk man it's just a thread...

Then went to the us consulate to register at their library, it's pretty good. And it was cool to enter foriegn soil in India...

But by then, no lunch and too many things taken up already..
The class didn't go well at all and I felt so tired.  

Came home and lunched before a tight sleep....
Bad dreams again.

Woke up and decided to just chill. Parks and rec. Shawarma and bit of rice ...and horlicks :P

Let's see hows the sleep this night.
