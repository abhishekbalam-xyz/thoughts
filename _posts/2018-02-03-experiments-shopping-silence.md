Woke up late today, but took a fresh bath and went to the temple in the morning..

So I was super psyched to switched to Netlify , because it all these new tools and integrated features 
- Https free with letsencrypt
- form handling
- functions/lambdas with github
- integrated dns
- cli to deploy
- supports other generators too (than jekyll)
- and a load of other stuff for free

Alas, after 3 hours wasted trying to fix up my site, I had alot of issues with the DNS , which is still in `beta` btw..

Another problem I faced was that there was so little support apart from the documentaion..

Maybe someday it will become good enough for that, I hope it works..

Did Check out surge though ...

Moved this site to Surge now, completely...Maybe Ill remove the fake repo and account?Maybe..

Surge is fucking quick too,coz it takes just the static content and propagates across its CDN quickly, unlike Github Pages..

Also..Cloudfront gives free SSL!! Netlify can suck ass now, I dont need it anymore..

I did it bitch! What an amazing time to live!

Mic drops, jumps into imaginary crowd cheering for having hosted a website (that too SSL encrypted) for a total of Rs.80 this year (just for the domain) ...
