Time never comes around for anyone. And from what I understand, this it is supposed the best phase of my life..

I dont want to be the guy who, later in life regrets not going after what he wants..

Beyond a certain age, one does not want to or can do a few things. Like my mom says:

> "One should do things right for their age, and do the right things at a certain age."

So I made a list of things I think I need to do, things I can't do later. Its not an exhaustive list and I'll update it regularily.
 
So here goes:

## Intern &#10004; &#10004; &#10004;

Internships are wonderful opportunities to experience working in a company. Do as many as you can, focus on the knowledge, technical and otherwise .

## Travel Alone &#10004;

It is important to learn lessons on:
- independence (physical, financial, and emotional)
- taking risks
- managing money
- survival
- navigating by yourself

## Make enough money to sustain by myself

Once you are an adult, you need to start working hard to become financially independent. You owe your parents that, your wings are whole and you need to leave the nest.

## Teach &#10004;

I think teaching involves much more learning for you, than the student. 

I intend to learn lessons on:
- articulating thoughts, make it understandible to others
- talking in front of an audience
- inspire as many kids to wonder and explore


## Be fit 

> "Take care of your body, it is the only place you live in"

I intend to work incrementally daily to keep good health. That means:
- Eating well (For energy)
- Working out well (For strength and enduarance)
- Meditating (For a healthy mind)

## Acquire as many Skills as I can

> "There is nothing more despicable than having ability and making no use of it."

I intend to learn as many skills as I possibly can, and use them to fulfill a greater purpose, which I haven't been able to see yet. 

## Take a Job

A man needs to work, simplest reason. 

## Have a side hustle

Another way not just to earn money, but to contibute to your place in the world.

## Love one person, hard

I've seen enough to realise that I'm the kind of guy who won't find satisfaction by chasing as many girls as possible. One person, total loyalty.

## Guide an underprivileged kid

I was very very fortunate to have been raised in a family that gave me all that I needed. 

Many kids, who might be much more talented and smarter than me, arent that fortunate. I intend to help one in terms of any support.

## Understand making and keeping money

Money for me is a token of freedom, and hence it should be resprected for its purpose, not just for its nature.

And making money isn't easy, and keeping it is harder. And the how, I intend to learn.
	
## Help others &#10004;

You owe the people before you (related or otherwise) a massive debt, who made the world as good as it is now. 

So you need to pay it back by helping others, by making their future better. 

## Respect the Gods &#10004;

I know that I am not a very pious man, but I respect the Gods (of any religion) and I intend to learn from the lessons offered by them. 

It doesnt matter if the Gods are real, my respect wont just be for a form of God, it's for the idea they represent.

## Trek as much as I can &#10004;

My 20s is the time when I am healthy, so I need to use the most of it to explore nature. 

To savor and respect all the gifts endowed to us by nature.

## Save for the future

The future is unpredictable. I can't know what will happen, but I can prepare.

I need to save a little money daily.
