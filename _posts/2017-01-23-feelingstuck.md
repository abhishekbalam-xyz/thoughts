After two unfavourable years and still going, I feel stuck today like all days when most things are going wrong.

## List of things going wrong
- I am sitting at home , after a year drop from college after jan-may 2017 fiasco, being completely useless.
- I have gained **15kgs** over the last 2-3 months and it sucks. 
- My hormones and neurotransmitters are all a mess.
- Cant fit into a routine
- Crazy animalistic apetite
- Mood swings

Ive tried therapy, Reiki, and alot of thing. And while fortunately I do feel better and the anxiety is almost gone.
I still take meds like Armod 50 ,it keeps my mind nimble and helps control my apetite and it all feels a little bad.

I never thought I'd feel like this, but I'm worried that I'm left behind , that my friends will judge me.
This is troubling, like im trying to prove to them that I am still awesome, not a loser.
I know, its pathetic.

So how do I deal with this?
