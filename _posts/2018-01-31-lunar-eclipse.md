Today was a rare occurrence of a Lunar eclipse and mom was all hyped up about itâ€¦

More importantly, I restarted my blog , The Curious Mumbaikar on Medium and it felt pretty good.

As yesterday, no exercise, alot of food.

Also, made a small python script. If I continue doing this ,I might actually build a decent toolset and have fun at it too..

Today I also began reading the Intelligent Investor, it's a heavy read. But slowly I'll manage..

Did learn basics of Perl, I think I'll start to use it more in Unix..

Plans to start yoga from tomm and do a bit of exercise, it's 3.05 am of the next day, let's see :P
