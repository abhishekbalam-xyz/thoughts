question generates anxiety-as a kid not so much- eager optimistic answers-but now, fear of pressure- by parents,family,society - change of outlook-as a kid starry eyed ambition- a fixed goal to become something- as you grow, you realize, not so much in control-u can subconsciously ask for things-not really expect them to succeed-luck-not getting-depressed-but when you see people like elon musk- you see hope- who seems like he is living a linear life-maybe that could be you- but life isnt that simple-its hardly ever linear-anyway, i digress. so my story- scientist-aptitude-engineer-then-biology-academics-engineering-computers-business-i screwed uop-what i want to do?- everything. Literally. thats what i want to die knowing. knowing I tried those things. That doesnt mean, I want to do stupid things and suffer, it means im open to both , the positives and negativies and postivies of life.

This question, when asked to an Indian youngster my age, would ideally generate any of the following two types of responses: 
1. An optimistic brief idea of what they plan to do for the next 5-10 years, with enthusiasm and very little apprehension
2. Nervous exressions accompanying vague plans to give a bunch of competitive exams to pursue further studies, or take up a job in an <X> field 
3. They shrug their shoulders , saying they dont know but some distress showing the underlying insecurity and fear they feel about their future prospects, sometimes hidden under an uneasy smile...

The former are the optimists, the confident trailblazers, ready to take on the world . They have been idealising a perfect life in their head for a long time and when finally given a chance to earn it, are prepared, emotionally, and with the skillset they have honed in their college years, to face the challenges the world has to offer.

They aren't idiots, they know it will be tough, they know what will it cost, but they aren't afraid because they have done their research, and they know how to improvise to knock the difficulties that come in their out of the park.They know this because they know what it takes to succeede, coz they know the focus and hardwork and sacrifices they need to make to get there, coz they had done all of it to get to where they are.

These are the startup guys, highest (salary) placed, the ones who got into the colleges of their choice. 
And now is the time of their lives, they feel like Gladiators entering the Colosseum, after alot of tortous practice to make a killing out there. High on the sweet nectar of success and high on andrenaline for the exciting future that lies ahead of them..

“ Annoying pompous turds! “, thought of as atleast once in the minds of the youngsters belonging to the other two demographics..

Their story is’nt all that glamorous, but a little bit more interesting.The truth is, the majority lies in the latter two demographics and their’s is the story no one talks about.

And this post is about them, the silent majority. 

Now lets explore the  story of the second group.

These are the realists 
- who don't care about being the best in a field 
- they don't have to prove the world anything about themselves 
- they aren't all that passionate about an idea

They are the ones who just want to just live a comfortable and happy life. All their decisions are centered around this basic idea , to secure their future . Simple.

They worked their ass off to study subjects they didn't really care about, but only because good grades were needed to secure their future and that was good enough motivation. They enjoyed the finer things college and school had to offer them, while being realistic about things.

They seem like the vanilla ice cream of the group, but it's a pretty comfortable sweet spot to be in..

Then come the last group.

Ahhh, they are the people who had juusst a little too much fun, studied a little bit lesser and occasionally threw causion to the air and went all in , enjoying their life.

These are the people who know how to live life! They do what they want and leave no stone unturned to fulfill their short term goals.

And alas, naturally, as bad grades transalate to a bad rep, irrespective of capability or intelligence, they aren't able to get placed and their future prospects seem dim.
