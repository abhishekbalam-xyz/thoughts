title: "Negativity attracts negative people."

---

I have realised recently that more negative you are, the more negative people you attract, and by attract I dont mean just romantically, in general.

I've seen this in my own life and I did meet many who were more negative and that affected me too..

After alot of effort, time and energy I have removed the negativity within me.

The inverse is also true though, more positive I am , more of those I attract..

That's my plan now...

It's not worth your time or energy to keep people around, who even though are well meaning, or are good people, so you got to drop them.

How do I try being positive?

1. I am optimistic about my future
2. Take care of your body
3. Sleep well
4. Eat clean, not junk
5. Keep setting goals, and strive to achieve them. Never settle.

Thats it for now.. 

Life is to be lived once, do it justice .
