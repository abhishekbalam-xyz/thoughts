Thank god for today, seriously.

After 3 shitty days, today was the detox I needed.

I met a _**comrade**_ after a while and we had a good time today. 

* Played a game called Sequences
* watched a good movie
* and had some food.
* nice lil nap after reaching home

all the things I needed to rest and relax. This was the reboot I needed, thanks to the comrade, may god bless her too big to fit head :P ...

So, now that's things are better , Ive gotta start to work at it again.

Fixing my icap python script to work on more grammatical errors..

Tbh, I'm not as excited about Perl as I thought I'd be, you'd know.
It's awesome,maybe, but I have'nt found any use for me yet..

WAIT, ill port icap to Perl..?
